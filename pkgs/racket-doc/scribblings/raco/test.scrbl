@title[#:tag "test"]{@exec{raco test}: Run tests}

@; For `history` to connect to the "compiler-lib" package:
@declare-exporting[compiler/commands/test]

The @exec{raco test} command requires and runs the (by default)
@racket[test] submodule associated with each path given on the command
line. Command-line flags can control which submodule is run, whether to
run the main module if no submodule is found, and whether to run tests
directly, in separate processes (the default), or in separate places.
The current directory is set to a test file's directory before running
the file.

When an argument path refers to a directory, @exec{raco test}
recursively discovers and runs all files within the directory that end
in a module suffix (see @racket[get-module-suffixes], but the suffixes
always include @filepath{.rkt}, @filepath{.scrbl}, @filepath{.ss}, and
@filepath{.scm}) or have a (possibly empty) list of command-line arguments provided by
@racket[test-command-line-arguments] in an @filepath{info.rkt} file,
or as directed by @racket[test-include-paths] in an
@filepath{info.rkt} file.  At the same time, @exec{raco test} omits
files and directories within a directory as directed by
@racket[test-omit-paths] in an @filepath{info.rkt} file.

A test is counted as failing if it logs a failing test code via
@racket[test-log!], causes Racket to exit with a non-zero exit code, or
(when @Flag{e} or @DFlag{check-stderr} is specified) if it produces
output on the error port.

The @exec{raco test} command accepts several flags:

@itemize[

 @item{@Flag{c} or @DFlag{collection}
       --- Interprets the arguments as collections whose content
       should be tested (in the same way as directory content),
       and makes @DFlag{process} the default testing mode.}

 @item{@Flag{p} or @DFlag{package}
       --- Interprets the arguments as packages whose contents should
       be tested (in the same way as directory content). All package
       scopes are searched for the first, most specific @tech[#:doc
       '(lib "pkg/scribblings/pkg.scrbl")]{package scope}. This flag also
       makes @DFlag{process} the default testing mode.}
 
 @item{@Flag{l} or @DFlag{lib}
       --- Interprets the arguments as libraries that should be tested.
       Each argument @nonterm{arg} is treated as a module path
       @racket[(lib "@nonterm{arg}")].
       The default testing mode is @DFlag{direct} if a single module is specified,
       @DFlag{process} if multiple modules are specified.}

 @item{@Flag{m} or @DFlag{modules}
       --- Not only interprets the arguments as paths (which is the
       default mode), but treats them the same as paths found in a
       directory, which means ignoring a file argument that does not
       have a module extension or is not enabled explicitly via
       @racket[test-command-line-arguments] or @racket[test-include-paths]
       in an @filepath{info.rkt} file; meanwhile, paths that are otherwise
       enabled can be disabled via @racket[test-omit-paths] in an
       @filepath{info.rkt} file.
       The default testing mode is @DFlag{direct} if a single path is specified,
       @DFlag{process} if multiple paths are specified.}

 @item{@DFlag{drdr}
       --- Configures defaults to imitate the DrDr continuous testing
       system: ignore non-modules, run tests in separate processes
       (unless @DFlag{thread} or @DFlag{direct} is specified) use as
       many jobs as available processors (unless @DFlag{jobs} is
       specified), set the default timeout to 90 seconds (unless
       @DFlag{timeout} is specified), create a fresh
       @envvar{PLTUSERHOME} and @envvar{TMPDIR} for each test, count
       stderr output as a test failure, quiet program output, provide
       empty program input, and print a table of results.}

 @item{@Flag{s} @nonterm{name} or @DFlag{submodule} @nonterm{name}
       --- Requires the submodule @nonterm{name} rather than @racket[test].
       Supply @Flag{s} or @DFlag{submodule} to run multiple submodules,
       or combine multiple submodules with @DFlag{first-avail} to
       run the first available of the listed modules.
       Beware that if you use @Flag{s} multiple times but supply a
       single module file as an argument, the default mode is still
       @DFlag{direct} (which likely means fewer fresh module
       instantiations than @DFlag{process} or @DFlag{place} mode).}

 @item{@Flag{r} or @DFlag{run-if-absent}
       --- Requires the top-level module of a file if a relevant submodule is not 
       present. This is the default mode.}

 @item{@Flag{x} or @DFlag{no-run-if-absent}
       --- Ignores a file if the relevant submodule is not present.}

 @item{@DFlag{first-avail}
       --- When multiple submodule names are provided with @Flag{s} or
       @DFlag{submodule}, runs only the first available submodule.}

@item{@DFlag{configure-runtime}
       --- Run a @racketidfont{configure-runtime} submodule (if any) of
       each specified module before the module or a
       submodule is run. This mode is the default when only a single
       module is provided or when @DFlag{process} or @DFlag{place}
       mode is specified, unless a submodule name is provided
       via @Flag{s} or @DFlag{submodule}.}

 @item{@DFlag{direct}
      --- Runs each test in a thread, using a single namespace's module
      registry to load all tests. This mode is the default if
      a single file is specified. Multiple tests can interfere with
      each other and the overall test run by exiting, using unsafe operations
      that block (and thus prevent timeout), and so on.}

 @item{@DFlag{process}
      --- Runs each test in a separate operating-system process. This
          mode is the default if multiple files are specified or if a
          directory, collection, or package is specified.}

 @item{@DFlag{place}
      --- Runs each test in a @tech[#:doc '(lib
      "scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")]{place}, instead of in an
      operating-system process.}

 @item{@Flag{j} @nonterm{n} or @DFlag{jobs} @nonterm{n}
      --- Runs up to @nonterm{n} test files in parallel.}

 @item{@DFlag{timeout} @nonterm{seconds}
      --- Sets the default timeout (after which a test counts as failed)
      to @nonterm{seconds}. Use @exec{+inf.0} to allow tests to run without
      limit but allow @racket[timeout] sub-submodule configuration.
      If any test fails due to a timeout, the exit status of @exec{raco test}
      is 2 (as opposed to 1 for only non-timeout failures or 0 for success).
      The default timeout corresponds to @exec{+inf.0} if not specified
      via @DFlag{timeout} or @DFlag{drdr}.}

 @item{@DFlag{fresh-user}
      --- When running tests in a separate process, creates a fresh
      directory and sets @envvar{PLTUSERHOME} and @envvar{TMPDIR}. The
      @envvar{PLTADDONDIR} environment variable is also set so that
      the add-on directory (which is where packages are installed, for
      example) does @emph{not} change for each test process.}

 @item{@DFlag{empty-stdin}
       --- Provide an empty stdin to each test program.}

 @item{@Flag{Q} or @DFlag{quiet-program}
       --- Suppresses output from each test program.}

 @item{@Flag{e} or @DFlag{check-stderr}
       --- Count any stderr output as a test failure.}

 @item{@DFlag{deps}
       --- If considering arguments as packages, also check package
       dependencies.}

 @item{@DPFlag{ignore-stderr} @nonterm{pattern}
       --- Don't count stderr output as a test failure if it matches
       @nonterm{pattern}.  This flag can be used multiple times, and
       stderr output is treated as success as long as it matches any
       one @nonterm{pattern}.}

 @item{@DFlag{errortrace}
       --- Dynamically loads @racketmodname[errortrace #:indirect]
       before running the tests. Note that already-compiled files will not
       include the tracing information.}
 @item{@Flag{y} or @DFlag{make}
       --- Enable automatic
        generation and update of compiled @filepath{.zo} files.
        Specifically, the
        result of
        @racket[(make-compilation-manager-load/use-compiled-handler)]
        is installed as the value of @racket[current-load/use-compiled]
        before module-loading actions.}

 @item{@Flag{q} or @DFlag{quiet}
       --- Suppresses output of progress information, responsible
       parties, and varying output (see @secref["test-responsible"]).}

 @item{@DFlag{heartbeat}
       --- Periodically report that a test is still running after
       the test has been running at least 5 seconds.}

 @item{@DFlag{table} or @Flag{t}
       --- Print a summary table after all tests. If a test uses
       @racketmodname[rackunit], or if a test at least uses
       @racket[test-log!] from @racketmodname[raco/testing] to log
       successes and failures, the table reports test and failure
       counts based on the log.}

 @item{@DPFlag{arg} @nonterm{argument}
       --- Adds @nonterm{argument} to the list of arguments to the invoked test module,
       so that the invoked module sees @nonterm{argument} in its
       @racket[current-command-line-arguments]. These arguments are
       combined with any arguments specified in @filepath{info.rkt}
       by @racket[test-command-line-arguments].}

 @item{@DPFlag{args} @nonterm{arguments}
        --- The same as @DPFlag{arg}, but @nonterm{arguments} is treated
        as a whitespace-delimited list of arguments to add. To specify
        multiple arguments using this flag within a typical shell,
        @nonterm{arguments} must be
        enclosed in quotation marks.}

 @item{@DFlag{output} or @Flag{o} @nonterm{file}
       --- Save all stdout and stderr output into @nonterm{file}.
       The target @nonterm{file} will be overwritten if it exists already.

@section[#:tag "test-config"]{Test Configuration by Submodule}

When @exec{raco test} runs a test in a submodule, a @racket[config]
sub-submodule can provide additional configuration for running the
test. The @racket[config] sub-submodule should use the
@racketmodname[info] module language to define the following
identifiers:

@itemlist[

 @item{@indexed-racket[timeout] --- a real number in seconds to override the default
       timeout for the test, which applies only when timeouts are
       enabled.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[responsible] --- a string, symbol, or list of symbols
       and strings identifying a responsible party that should be
       notified when the test fails. See @secref["test-responsible"].}

 @item{@indexed-racket[lock-name] --- a string that names a lock file that is
       used to serialize tests (i.e., tests that have the same lock
       name do not run concurrently). The lock file's location is
       determined by the @envvar{PLTLOCKDIR} environment variable or
       defaults to @racket[(find-system-path 'temp-dir)]. The maximum
       time to wait on the lock file is determined by the
       @envvar{PLTLOCKTIME} environment variable or defaults to 4
       hours.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[ignore-stderr] --- a string, byte string, or
       @tech[#:doc reference-doc]{regexp value}, as a pattern that
       causes error output to not be treated as a failure if the
       output matches the pattern.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[random?] --- if true, indicates that the test's output
       is expected to vary. See @secref["test-responsible"].}

]

In order to prevent evaluation of a file for testing purposes, it
suffices to create a submodule that does not perform any tests and
does not trigger the evaluation of the enclosing module. So, for
instance, a file might look like this:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader
 (racketmod
  racket

  (/ 1 0)

  ;; don't run this file for testing:
  (module test racket/base)
 )

@history[#:changed "1.5" @elem{Added @racket[ignore-stderr] support.}]

@section[#:tag "test-config-info"]{Test Configuration by @filepath{info.rkt}}

Submodule-based test configuration is preferred (see
@secref["test-config"]). In particular, to prevent @exec{raco test}
from running a particular file, normally the file should contain a
submodule that takes no action.

In some cases, however, adding a submodule is inconvenient or
impossible (e.g., because the file will not always compile). Thus,
@exec{raco test} also consults any @filepath{info.rkt} file in the
candidate test file's directory. In the case of a file within a
collection, @filepath{info.rkt} files from any enclosing collection
directories are also consulted for @racket[test-omit-paths] and
@racket[test-include-paths]. Finally, for a file within a package, the
package's @filepath{info.rkt} is consulted for @racket[pkg-authors] to
set the default responsible parties (see @secref["test-responsible"])
for all files in the package.

The following @filepath{info.rkt} fields are recognized:

@itemlist[

 @item{@indexed-racket[test-omit-paths] --- a list of path strings (relative
       to the enclosing directory) and regexp values (to omit all
       files within the enclosing directory matching the expression),
       or @racket['all] to omit all files within the enclosing directory.
       When a path string refers to a directory, all files within the
       directory are omitted.}

 @item{@indexed-racket[test-include-paths] --- a list of path strings (relative
       to the enclosing directory) and regexp values (to include all
       files within the enclosing directory matching the expression),
       or @racket['all] to include all files within the enclosing directory.
       When a path string refers to a directory, all files within the
       directory are included.}
      
 @item{@indexed-racket[test-command-line-arguments] --- a list of
       @racket[(list _module-path-string (list _argument-path-string
       ...))], where @racket[current-command-line-arguments] is set to
       a vector that contains the @racket[_argument-path-string] when
       running @racket[_module-path-string].}

 @item{@indexed-racket[test-timeouts] --- a list of @racket[(list
       _module-path-string _real-number)] to override the default
       timeout in seconds for @racket[_module-path-string].}

 @item{@indexed-racket[test-responsibles] --- a list of @racket[(list
       _module-path-string _party)] or @racket[(list 'all _party)] to
       override the default responsible party for
       @racket[_module-path-string] or all files within the directory
       (except as overridden), respectively. Each @racket[_party] is a
       string, symbol, or list of symbols and strings. See
       @secref["test-responsible"].}

 @item{@indexed-racket[test-lock-names] --- a list of @racket[(list
       _module-path-string _lock-string)] to declare a lock file name
       for @racket[_module-path-string]. See @racket[lock-name] in
       @secref["test-config"].}

 @item{@indexed-racket[test-ignore-stderrs] --- a list of @racket[(list
       _module-path-string _pattern)] or @racket[(list 'all _pattern)]
       to declare patterns of standard error output that are allowed a
       non-failures for @racket[_module-path-string] or all files
       within the directory. Each @racket[_pattern] must be a string,
       byte string, or @tech[#:doc reference-doc]{regexp value}. See
       @racket[ignore-stderr] in @secref["test-config"].}

 @item{@indexed-racket[test-randoms] --- a list of path strings (relative to
       the enclosing directory) for modules whose output varies.
       See @secref["test-responsible"].}

 @item{@racket[module-suffixes] and @racket[doc-module-suffixes] ---
       Used indirectly via @racket[get-module-suffixes].}

@history[#:changed "1.5" @elem{Added @racket[test-ignore-stderrs] support.}]

@section[#:tag "test-responsible"]{Responsible-Party and Varying-Output Logging}

When a test has a declared responsible party, then the test's output
is prefixed with a

@verbatim[#:indent 2]{raco test:@nonterm{which} @"@"(test-responsible '@nonterm{responsible})}

line, where @nonterm{which} is a space followed by an exact
non-negative number indicating a parallel task when parallelism is
enabled (or empty otherwise), and @nonterm{responsible} is a string,
symbol, or list datum.

When a test's output (as written to stdout) is expected to vary across
runs---aside from varying output that has the same form as produced by
@racket[time]---then it should be declared as varying. In that case,
the test's output is prefixed with a

@verbatim[#:indent 2]{raco test:@nonterm{which} @"@"(test-random #t)}

line.

@section{Logging Test Results}
@defmodule[raco/testing]

This module provides a general purpose library for tracking test results
and displaying a summary message. The command @exec{raco test} uses this library
to display test results. Therefore, any testing framework that wants to integrate
with @exec{raco test} should also use this library to log test results.

@history[#:added "1.13"]

@defproc[(test-log! [result any/c]) void?]{
 Adds a test result to the running log. If @racket[result] is false,
 then the test is considered a failure.}

@defproc[(test-report [#:display? display? any/c #f]
                      [#:exit? exit? any/c #f])
         (cons/c exact-nonnegative-integer?
                 exact-nonnegative-integer?)]{
 Processes the running test log. The first integer is the failed tests, the
 second is the total tests. If @racket[display?] is true, then a message is
 displayed. If there were failures, the message is printed on
 @racket[(current-error-port)]. If @racket[exit?] is true, then if there were
 failures, calls @racket[(exit 1)].}

@defboolparam[test-log-enabled? enabled? #:value #t]{
 When set to @racket[#f], @racket[test-log!] is a no-op. This is useful to
 dynamically disable certain tests whose failures are expected and shouldn't be
 counted in the test log, such as when testing a custom check's failure
 behavior.}

@defparam*[current-test-invocation-directory
            path

Contains the directory from which tests were invoked by, @emph{e.g.}, @exec{raco
test}. This may differ from @racket[current-directory] when the test runner
changes directory before invoking a specific test file and should be set by test
runners to reflect the directory from which they were originally invoked.

This should be used by test reports to display appropriate path names.
